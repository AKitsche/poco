R package for power and sample size calculations for consistency assessment

In this package provides power and sample size calculations for the analysis of treatment-by-subgroup interactions for continuous and binary response variables:

- calculate the power to detect an interaction effect (also qualitative interactions)

- calculate sample size to detect an interaction effect (also qualitative interactions)

- calculate power for consistency assessment

- calculate sample size for consistency assessment
